A Path of Exile helper that shows item prices using the official Path of Exile Trade API.

## Description
If you used [POE-TradeMacro](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro), it's the same idea.

Sidekick should be able to price check almost every item, the idea is to eventually be able to modify your search on-the-fly and configure which attributes are selected by default depending on the item type.

## Installation
1. [Download Sidekick](https://github.com/domialex/Sidekick/releases/latest/download/Sidekick.exe)
2. Install **[.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/thank-you/runtime-desktop-3.1.4-windows-x64-installer)** if needed
3. Run Sidekick.exe

## Usage
1. Add an exception for **Sidekick.exe** in your anti-virus, some people have reported that it can block Sidekick in some cases.
2. Run **Sidekick.exe**.
3. Select your league in the settings if needed.
4. Put **Path of Exile** in **Windowed** or **Windowed Fullscreen** mode for best results.
5. In **Path of Exile**, hover an item and press **Ctrl+D** (default binding).
